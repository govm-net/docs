# Authority control

Data can only be read and written by the smart contract to which it belongs. By default, smart contracts cannot read or write data from other smart contracts.  
In order to facilitate user operations, the private object of the smart contract is used as the data object. The system obtains the smart contract and object name to which the private object belongs through reflection. Other smart contracts cannot create and obtain private objects of the smart contract, and cannot read or write corresponding data.  
If a smart contract wants its data to be read and written by other smart contracts, it is necessary for the smart contract to actively provide a data operation interface. Other smart contracts refer to the contract and call the corresponding interface to operate the corresponding data.  
Smart contracts allow reading the log data of the same smart contracts on other chains. This method enables smart contracts to transfer data across chains; through different chains, data is processed in parallel.
