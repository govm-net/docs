# Data Type

All data is in the form of simple key: value, and key and value are byte arrays. Data reading and writing both consume a fee (Energy). All data writes can only be written on this chain.  
**DB-type data**:  
ordinary and commonly used storage types, supporting arbitrary reading and writing of smart contracts.  
**Log-type data**:  
Log-type data, which allows cross-chain reading and does not allow overwriting.
