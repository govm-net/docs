# Pain points

The low performance of the public chain severely restricts the use of  application. The existing phenomenon is that an application uses a chain, computing power, users cannot share, low credibility (island problem). Most public chain performance is limited by the performance bottleneck of a single node. The theoretical upper limit of the theoretical performance TPS of ordinary computer nodes is about 7,000 TPS, which is difficult to meet the demand.  
Alipay can pay hundreds of thousands TPS on the day of Double Eleven and other activities.  
With the promotion of smart contracts, more and more applications will use smart contracts, the performance requirements for public chains will increase again.  
CryptoKitties lead to the congestion of the entire Ethereum network.  
An airdrop project, EIDOS, caused serious congestion in the EOS network.
