# Block time interval

Time interval: the time difference between adjacent blocks on a chain. The smaller the time interval, the faster the block generation speed, and the higher the TPS.  
In this system, the minimum unit of time is 1 millisecond.  
The time interval of the first chain is 1 minute, and the time interval of the new chain is reduced to 15/16 of its parent chain, so the time interval of the second chain is 56250 milliseconds.  
The new chain has smaller time intervals and faster block generation.  
The block time interval of the block can be adjusted, and the maximum is 1 minute.
