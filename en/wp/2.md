# Consensus algorithm

PORW: Proof of Register and Work, registration work certificate, it is equivalent to POW+POS.  
Holders of tokens can be registered as miners.The registered miner has a addition when calculating the hash power, which makes it easier to get rewards.  
the miner is registered with the mine right of a particular block, and the tokens for registration will be frozen for a period of time (50000 blocks, about a month) to avoid the miner being a registered miner all the time. The tokens of registration exceed block rewards.  
Unregistered miners can also mine, except that there is no addition.  
Each block allows up to 11 registered miners. The system does not have pre-allocated tokens, so the initial owners do not have tokens, at this time, there are no re gistered miners, only POW as a consensus mechanism.  
Block generation time is fixed and defaults to 1 minute a block with the highest computational power selected each time as the new block.  
Registration as a miner is through registration transactions completed, all registration information is on the chain, transparent and public.  
To ensure that the miner's identity of the block is not misused, each block will carry the miner's signature. this way can also limit the size of the public mine pool. Because each time you calculate a block hash, you need to sign the block first. If the pool publishes its private key, its tokens can be transferred at any time; if the private key is not published, it can only be signed by itself, each time the signature is completed, and then given to the miner to calculate the hash, then the signature speed of the pool will become the biggest bottleneck and will be difficult to satisfy, and the network ability between the pool and the miner will be the bottleneck. This greatly limits the size of the pool.  

## Block confirmation

Use PORW, so it's like BitCoin, to make sure a transaction is irreversible, can wait for 6 blocks to confirm. the default one block generation time is 1 minute, so the block confirmation time is 6 minute.
