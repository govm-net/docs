# Concept

If a chain A creates a new chain B, chain A is the parent chain of chain B and chain B is the child chain of chain A.  
The system initially has only one chain, it has no parent chain, and other chains have parent chains.  
Each chain can create 2 child chains, which are called left child chain and right child chain.
