# Logical relationship between chains

![relationship](chains.png)
All chains will form a binary tree, and this is their logical relationship.  
The chain ID is a 64-bit number, starting from 1, so there can be up to 2 ^ 64-1 chains.  
Each chain can have 2 child chains.  
In this way, the number and location of the chains are determined, facilitating expansion and cross-chain access.
