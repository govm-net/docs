# Breakthrough single node performance

As mentioned earlier, the theoretical upper limit of the TPS of an ordinary computer is about 7,000 TPS.  
If we want to make the TPS of the whole system higher, one way is to use a high-performance computer, and the other is to change the single computer processing to multiple computer processing.  
This system uses a multi-chain method. Chains and chains can be processed in parallel, so processing of different chains can be placed on different computers to achieve parallel processing, avoiding single-node hardware, network and other bottlenecks.  
In this way, the system performance can be linearly increased according to the increase of the chain.  
If the performance of a node is insufficient, a new computer can be added to transfer the processing of part of the chain to the new computer, thereby improving the node's hardware and network capabilities.
